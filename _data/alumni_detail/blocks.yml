      Experience: I have been with AUV IITK since the first semester. We got the opportunity to acquire some basic skills in various domains which turned out to be really helpful in the coming semesters. It was because I joined AUV that I could explore and find my interest. It has been a great learning experience for me and I sincerely recommend freshers to consider joining the team.

    #   Experience: AUV-IITK was the first technical project in which I was involved and it definitely had a big impact. I learned stuffs ranging from doing code in OpenCV to carrying heavy stuffs at 45 degrees heat of IIT Kanpur to the Swimming pool but above all made awesome friends with like minded interests which I feel is the best part of being involved in any club activity.
